(Project language file 1 )
(For: seanpm2001/Learn-G-Code/ )
(About: )
(I decided to make G-CODE the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-G-CODE) as G-CODE is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the G-CODE programming language. It only makes sense to G-CODE the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here. )

(Header end.)
THIS IS NOT A VALID G-CODE FILE. PLEASE DO NOT RUN IT AND EXPECT FUNCTIONALITY. I hope that this line outside the header just prints output to the console of the program it was opened in.
